    "### Defining heat flux\n",
    "\n",
    "Heat flux is the flow of energy through a surface over a period of time.  Ocean surface heat flux is a critical component of Earth’s climate system.  The impact of global warming due to anthropogenic pollution has had a disproportionately large effect on the world’s oceans; it has been estimated that ~90% of the warming has been absorbed by the oceans. Nearly all oceanic heating is driven by air-sea interaction where incoming solar energy warms the upper ocean and outgoing heat loss cools it.  The primary processes that lead to heat **loss** through the ocean surface are long-wave radiation (or ‘back radiation’), latent heat flux, and sensible heat flux.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anything that has a temperature emits electromagnetic radiation.  High temperature sources like the sun emit shortwave radiation, while cooler temperature sources like the ocean give off **long-wave radiation**.  When long-wave radiation is emitted from the ocean, it releases heat.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Latent heat flux** is an energy exchange that occurs between the ocean and atmosphere when water changes state.  Water evaporates from the ocean surface becoming water vapor in the atmosphere.  This can be thought of as the ocean ‘sweating’.  Humans sweat to cool down (i.e., water evaporates off our skin removing heat from our body) and so does the ocean. As water changes from liquid to vapor, a tremendous amount of energy is released across the air-sea interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sensible heat flux** is heat exchange by conduction.  When two objects with different temperatures are put in contact with each other, heat flows from the hotter object to the colder one. Since the water is typically warmer than the ambient air, heat energy is transferred from the ocean to the atmosphere.\n",

    "### Bulk formula for heat flux\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking direct measurements of heat fluxes in the ocean can be very challenging. Imagine attempting to take careful measurements of evaporated seawater while being rocked around by winds, storms, and waves!  Scientists have addressed this hurdle by developing algorithms, called **bulk formulas**, to serve as proxies in lieu of direct measurements.  A bulk formula roughly captures the intended processes based on environmental properties that are much easier to measure, such as temperature, wind speed, and humidity.  There is a wealth of data, collected from many platforms in and around the ocean, that can provide the necessary elements for calculating heat fluxes. \n",

The instrumentation on this buoy collects a range of meteorological parameters including those needed for calculating the latent and sensible heat fluxes. The buoy collects data at 2 meters below the surface, which is approximated as the surface of the water column. The depth of the water column at this location is 26 meters.\n",

    "Incoming solar radiation and outgoing long-wave radiation are a bit more difficult to determine and the values are generally taken from a ‘reanalysis dataset’.  Reanalysis datasets are created by combining observations with numerical modeling outputs.  This lab uses data from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) from National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) (https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.narr.html). The buoy data and the NARR reanalysis data can be used to understand aspects of the complex relationship between water temperature and air-sea interactions. "
