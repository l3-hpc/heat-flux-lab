# The Heat Flux Lab 
University of South Alabama

## How to use
- Clicking on the "launch binder" icon will start the Notebook
- Be patient, it might take some time.  It is starting up a VM (little computer in the cloud), installing all the necessary Python packages, and loading the data...and all for free!
